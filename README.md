The purpose of the game is to fly as high as you can. The bird is controlled by the LEFT and RIGHT or A and D keys on the keyboard. As long as you fly higher, the gap 
between the pipes and the space between each pair of pipes is getting smaller, what makes the game harder.

I used SFML version 2.5.1 using <SFML/Graphics.hpp> library. The pipes are created randomly (I used srand() from cstdlib.h and rand() from random.h). Further 
information about the design and code can be found in the documentation.

*IMPORTANT* - If you wish to run the game, you can downlaod the "Fly High release" package and run the "FlyHigh.exe" file. 

Have fun!
