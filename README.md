The purpose of the game is to fly as high as you can. The bird is controlled by the LEFT and RIGHT or A and D keys on the keyboard. The pipes are created randomly (I used srand() from <cstdlib> and rand() from random.h). I used SFML version 2.5.1 using <SFML/Graphics.hpp> library. As long as you fly higher, the gap between the pipes and the space between each pipe set is getting smaller, what makes the game harder. Further information about the design and the code can be found in the documentation.

*IMPORTANT* - If you wish to run the game, make sure you change every path on the AbstractGameFactory.cpp to the location in ypur computer, to upload the textures and the font. All of those are located in the "resources" file.

Have fun!
